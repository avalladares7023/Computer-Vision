# Curve Tool in Computational Photography

The main objective for this project is to explain and implement a curve tool for image and video editing that controls the brightness or contrast of a video or image. Specifically, this progject is meant to illustrate how the effects changing an image's contrast or brightness has on the video's histogram.

## Report

The **Curve Tool in Computational Photography** PDF is a report meants to discuss the implementation details and observations made for each change in brightness and contrast  as well as the testing process of comparing the results with the histograms seen in Premiere Pro.

## Reference Images

The videos in the project serve as reference to illustrate how changing the videos contrast and brightness affects the original videos histogram. 

## C++ Programs

Each program is meant to implement a method of allowing the user alternate a video's contrast or brightness.

- **changeContrast.cpp**: Changes a given video's contrast by either increasing or decreasing it.
- **changeBrightness.cpp**: Changes a given video's brightness by either increasing or decreasing it.

## Adobe Premiere Pro Project

The Adobe Premiere Project is meant to serve as a comparison for testing the programs accuracy on how the video would change for each change in the videos brightness and contrast. Additionally, the project is used to help further demonstrate how changing the original image or video brightness or contrast affects the histogram.
